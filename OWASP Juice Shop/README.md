Click on the `Intruder` tab.
![](./screenshots/09.png) <br>
Select the Clear `ยง` button. In the password field place two `ยง` inside the quotes. <br>
![](./screenshots/10.png) <br>
For payload, we need to install this first. <br>
Email should be: <br>
```
admin@juice-sh.op
```
Install `seclists` for wordlists. <br>
```bash
apt-get install seclists
```
![](./screenshots/11.png) <br>

After installtion completed, load the wordlist from the location ` /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt`. <br>

![](./screenshots/12.png) <br>
Then `Start Attack`. <br>
![](./screenshots/13.png) <br>

Waiting until the attack finished. <br>
![](./screenshots/14.png) <br>

You can see the progress beneath. <br>

# [Task 6] Who's flying this thing?
## Q1. Access the administration page!
In this case, I use the Chromes browser by Burp. <br>
![](./screenshots/25.png) <br>
Search for `admin`. Find this one showing the path `administration`. <br>
![](./screenshots/26.png) <br>
![](./screenshots/27.png) <br>

## Flag
```
946a799363226a24822008503f5d1324536629a0
```

## Q2. View another user's shopping basket!
Login as an Admin. Before clicking on `Your Basket`, ensure the option is `Intercept is on`, then click the button. <br>
![](./screenshots/28.png) <br>

Now we get the request, modify the first line into the following: <br>
```
GET /rest/basket/1 HTTP/1.1
```
Press `Forward` the navigate to the browser to see result.
![](./screenshots/30.png) <br>
This one has on item in the basket. <br>
Let's change UserID to `2`.  We can see an item in the basket now. <br>
![](./screenshots/31.png) <br>

Turn the option into `Intercept is off`, then navigate back to the home page. Flag will pop up. <br>
![](./screenshots/29.png) <br>

### Flag
```

```

## Q3. Remove all 5-star reviews!
Naviaget to the page `http://10.10.166.22/#/administration`, and then delete the 5-star feedback. <br>
![](./screenshots/33.png) <br>
Well, delete them all works too. <br>

### Flag

# Bonus
## Bonus Payload
![](./screenshots/35.png) <br>

Insert the XSS DOM in the search bar. <br>
```
<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/771984076&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
```
![](./screenshots/34.png) <br>

## Exposed Metrics
Navigate to the page `/metrics`. <br>
![](./screenshots/36.png) <br>

## Missing Encoding
- Go to `/#/photo-wall`. Open inspector (I use Chrome by Burp in this case) or press F12. <br>
![](./screenshots/37.png) <br>
- Inspect the invalid photo ``. <br>
![](./screenshots/38.png) <br>



![](./screenshots/39.png) <br>
You will find the path of this photo. <br>
```
http://<YOUR_MACHINE_IP>/assets/public/images/uploads/%F0%9F%98%BC-#zatschi-#whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg
```
![](./screenshots/40.png) <br>

You can find the encoding character-set for URL in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP). <br>
![](./screenshots/41.png) <br>

As the question suggested, we have the missing endoing method for this path. Now we just need to change the hashtag(`#`) into the encoding input (`%23`), so it's valid in the URL. <br>

## Answer
```
